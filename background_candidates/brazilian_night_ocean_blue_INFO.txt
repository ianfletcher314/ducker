Why it matches the Ducker plugin color scheme:
----------------------------------------------
The Ducker plugin uses a blue-dominant color scheme with purple accents:
- Primary accent: Blue (#4a9eff)
- Secondary: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Background: Dark gray (#1a1a1a)
- LED color: Red (#ff3333)

This night ocean image features:
- Deep blue tones that complement the plugin's blue accent color
- Dark atmosphere matching the plugin's dark UI aesthetic
- Subtle variations of blue/purple that align with the ducking visualizations
- Brazilian coastal aesthetic (Rio de Janeiro-inspired ocean views)

Recommended usage:
- Apply with low opacity (10-20%) behind the main UI
- Slight darkening may be needed to maintain knob/control visibility
- Consider a subtle blue gradient overlay to enhance color harmony
